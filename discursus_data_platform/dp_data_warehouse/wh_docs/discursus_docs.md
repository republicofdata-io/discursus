{% docs action_geo_latitude %}

Action geo latitude is a geographical coordinate system used for describing positions on the planet's surface. It is similar to standard latitude and longitude, except that it is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds instead of decimal degrees. Action geo latitude helps determine a user's location, which can then be used to provide more accurate local information and services.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs action_geo_longitude %}

Action Geo Longitude is a type of data that is used to identify a location on Earth using a set of geospatial coordinates. This data includes the coordinates of a location on a map of the world, a measure of its distance east or west of the Prime Meridian, and the direction of the reference longitude, either east or west of the Prime Meridian. The coordinates and direction should be provided in a citation form (e.g. longitude 138.75 degrees east).

{% docs movement_fk %}

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references theprimary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them. A foreign key can be thought of as “pointing” to its respective primary key in another table.

{% docs event_fk %}

An event foreign key is a reference to a primary key in another table. It is used to link two tables together and identify related records in each table. For example, a company's Employees table may contain employee records and an Events table may contain information about events that employees attend. The foreign key in the Events table would then point to the Employees table, allowing the two tables to be linked together.

{% docs observation_type %}

Observation type is a method of data collection that involves directly observing variables of interest in their natural environment without manipulating them in any way. Observational types include observational studies, surveys, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, archival data, and naturalistic observations.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs observation_url %}

Observation URL is a URL used to access web-based observations made by satellites, weather radar, and other remote sensing devices. The URL typically references an online mapping service that displays the geographically referenced observation data over an interactive map.
